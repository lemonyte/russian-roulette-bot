class ConfigBase:
    """Superclass for populating config classes upon instantiation.

    Config classes define fields with type annotations, and optionally a default value.
    Fields will be populated with values from a YAML file, or the default value if no value is found.
    If a field is missing from the YAML file and no default value is provided, an exception is raised.

    Note:
        Parsing objects inside lists is not supported and will be returned as dictionaries.
        Parameterized types such as `list[str]` are not supported.
        To nest config classes, assign an instance of the nested class to the field.

    Args:
        obj_path (str): A dot-separated path to an object in the YAML file that contains the class's fields.
            If not provided, the class's fields are assumed to be at the root of the YAML file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If 'obj_path' does not point to an existing object in the YAML file.
        ValueError: If a field is missing from the YAML file and no default value is provided.
        TypeError: If a field's value in the YAML file is not of the correct type.
